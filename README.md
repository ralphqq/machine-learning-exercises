## machine-learning-exercises-notebooks
This repo contains my solutions to the exercises in Prof. Andrew Ng's highly-recommended machine learning course. I've done the exercises in Python and not the course's official Octave language. Most of the approach closely follows the ideas in a [series of blog posts by John Wittenhauer](http://www.johnwittenauer.net/machine-learning-exercises-in-python-part-1/) who also carried out the exercises in the Python language.

I'm still following the course right now (though I didn't officially sign up), and so I'll be posting additional notebooks as I go along.

Please feel free to comment or to correct my work. Thanks.
